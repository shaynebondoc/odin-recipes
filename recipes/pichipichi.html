            <li>2 16-oz pack frozen grated cassava thawed, and drained if excessively liquidy</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups pandan water can substitute with plain water</li>
            <li>1 tsp lye water</li>
            <li>½ tsp pandan extract</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>To Make Pandan Water</h3>
            <li>Place a bunch of pandan leaves in a pot with 3 cups of water and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Bring down to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes or until you start to smell that lovely pandan smell.</li>
            <li>Take out the pandan leaves and allow the pandan water to come down to room temperature before using</li>
            <h3>To Make Pichi-pichi</h3>
            <li> Place all your ingredients in a bowl and stir until blended well.</li>
            <li>Transfer your mixture into individual moulds or into a baking pan (whatever would fit in your steamer).</li>
            <li>Steam the pichi pichi until completely translucent, springy and soft to the touch. How long would depend on the size of moulds you use – from 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool completely before removing from moulds or scooping from pan. This would allow the pichi pichi to set completely.</li>
            <li>Once ready, if using moulds, gently nudge the pichi pichi free.</li>
            <li>If using a pan, you can use a melon baller to scoop out pieces of pichi pichi. A cookie scoop for bigger pieces will work too.</li>
            <li>Roll the pichi pichi in grated coconut or grated cheese and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
