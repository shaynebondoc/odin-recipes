        <p>
            At the heart of Pork Sinigang lies a flavorful broth that's both tangy and savory. The secret to its distinctive tanginess comes from the carefully selected souring agent, often tamarind, which infuses the broth with a lively and refreshing zing. This unique sour note is perfectly complemented by the succulent chunks of pork, which simmer to melt-in-your-mouth perfection, delivering an irresistible umami richness.

            <li>1 6-inch radish (labanos), peeled and sliced to ½-inch thick half-rounds</li>
            <li>2 finger chilies (siling haba)</li>
            <li>½ bunch long beans (sitaw), ends trimmed and cut into 3-inch lengths</li>
            <li>1 eggplant, ends trimmed and sliced to ½-inch thick half-rounds</li>
            <li>6 pieces okra, ends trimmed</li>
            <li>15 pieces large tamarind or 1 ½ (1.41 ounces each) packages tamarind base powder</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 bunch bok choy or pechay, ends trimmed and separated into leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse pork ribs and drain well.</li>
            <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.</li>
            <li>Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer for about 1 to 1 ½ hours or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 8 cups.</li>
            <li>Add gabi and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.</li>
            <li>Add chili peppers and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>If using packaged tamarind base, add to the pot and stir until completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <h3>If Using Fresh Tamarind</h3>
            <li>Wash tamarind and place in a saucepan with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and cook until soft and outer skins begin to burst.</li>
            <li>With a fork, mash tamarinds.</li>
            <li>In a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, pour tamarind and liquid. Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice, to fully extract the juice.</li>
            <li>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot of sinigang.</li>
        </ol>
